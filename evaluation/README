Simple example to work 
1) crawl top 100 from Alexa  - DONE (with issues)
2) s_server serving some content - DONE
3) s_client getting some content - DONE
    3a) how to measure performance -- ??
4) plot some statistics (check https paper for some basic ones) - TO DO     


* get microbenchmarks going for regular openssl
1) find code - DONE + check for that tool 
2) read related work - TO DO 

* start writing description of methodology and results - ONGOING

* port s_client and s_server
1) discuss with Kyle about APIs and how to po
2) go through the code, undersand and comment

* extend measurement to work with our library -- TO DO 

*  openssl and planetlab 
1) compile our own version  
2) compile new version with ALPN support and integrate with crawler 
3) alternative is focus on subset with empire or other more recent machine? (time is a problem, even a week is not enough ~1000hrs...)
